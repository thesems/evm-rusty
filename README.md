# Rusty EVM

EVM is an educational project designed to recreate a simplified Ethereum-like blockchain. Its primary focus is on
providing a deeper understanding of the **Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)**, **Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs)**,
and the broader concepts related to the execution layer of blockchains. This project aims to demystify how Ethereum
operates under the hood, making it a helpful resource for developers and blockchain enthusiasts interested in the
inner workings of decentralized systems.

## Goals of the Project

1. **Deep Dive into EVM Operations**: By replicating EVM functionality, the project allows users to understand how the
   execution environment of Ethereum processes instructions. Topics explored include:
    - Gas estimation and execution costs.
    - Opcodes and how they're processed.
    - Memory, storage, and the stack within the EVM.

2. **Understanding of EIPs**: understand how and why the project evolved. Notable include:
   - EIP-1559
   - Others

## Why Rust?

Rust is chosen for its performance, safety, and modern tooling ecosystem, making it an ideal language for implementing
blockchain-related concepts like state management, cryptographic operations, and low-level virtual machines.
